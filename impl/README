What is in packages?

The directory packages has an application, named chromeless, and also has libraries, such as addon-kit, and jetpack-core. This can be really confusing because it's all flat in the same directory. So tag cloud: 

App: chromeless

Library: jetpack-core, addon-kit 

Execution

cfx run executes xulrunner or firefox in 'app' mode. You should check the python-lib/__init__.py and runner. The initial application, that is passed as initial point of execution to xulrunner||firefox, is located also under python-lib/app-extention ( for Firefox ) or python-lib/Test\ App ( for XUlrunner ).
