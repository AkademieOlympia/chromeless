This is the Chromeless Project 

You can use run to get things started. It will try to call xulrunner, if not it will try to launch firefox in "xulrunner" mode --app. If you want to force Firefox execution, edit run script or call cfx manually, as run script does, and pass the parameter -b path_to_your_Firefox_browser. If you are on Mac OS X, do not end this path with a slash

Launch a browser script from the command line: 

./impl/bin/cfx -a xulrunner -p impl/packages/chromeless/ run -b ~marciogalli/Desktop/Firefox3.6.1.app --static-args {\"browser\":\"first_browser/index.html\"}
