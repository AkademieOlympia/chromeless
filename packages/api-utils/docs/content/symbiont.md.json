Rather, it is\nintended to be used by other modules that provide APIs to programs.\n\n\nThis module exports `Symbiont` trait that can be used for creating JavaScript\ncontexts that can access web content in host application frames (i.e. XUL\n`<iframe>` and `<browser>` elements) and communicate with programs via\nasynchronous JSON pipes.  It is useful in the construction of APIs that\nare compatible with the execution model codenamed \"electrolysis\" in which\nprograms run in separate processes from web content.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\n`Symbiont` constructs a content symbiont for a given frame, it loads the\nspecified contentURL and scripts into it, and plumbs an asynchronous\nJSON pipe between the content symbiont object and the content symbiont\ncontext. If frame is not provided hidden frame will be created.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n    const { Symbiont } = require('content');\n    const Thing = Symbiont.resolve({ constructor: '_init' }).compose({\n      constructor: function Thing(options) {\n        // `getMyFrame` returns the host application frame in which\n        // the page is loaded.\n        this._frame = getMyFrame();\n        this._init(options)\n      }\n    });\n\nSee the [panel] module for a real-world example of usage of this module.\n\n[panel]:#module/api-utils/panel\n\nReference\n---------\n\n"], ["api-json", {"line_number": 44, "name": "Symbiont", "constructors": [{"line_number": 52, "name": "Symbiont", "params": [{"line_number": 55, "name": "options", "required": true, "props": [{"line_number": 59, "required": false, "type": "object", "name": "frame", "description": "The host application frame in which the page is loaded.\nIf frame is not provided hidden one will be created."}, {"line_number": 62, "required": false, "type": "string", "name": "contentScriptWhen", "description": "When to load the content scripts.
